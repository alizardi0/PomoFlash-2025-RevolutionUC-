## Setup

Place a .env file in both ./.devcontainer/.env and ./.env that contain the same environment variables as listed in example.env. If you're using Linux or Mac this can be a symlink.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
